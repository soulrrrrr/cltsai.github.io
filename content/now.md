The idea of a Now page is to tell you about what I am doing now.

## Attending UIUC
I am going to study Computer Science at UIUC! Although I am excited, there are many challenges I will have to face, such as language barriers, securing internships, and adapting to a new culture. I hope everything goes well!

## Preparing the trip to Japan
I will visit Japan for 10 days this summer. My last visit was 7 years ago, and many of my friends have told me that Japan has changed a lot since then. I am excited to see whatâ€™s new and to enjoy the food and temples.
